double d = 3/2 
cout<<d ;
output is 1 as the flow is right to left for any statement 
so first it will be divivded and a at last it will get stored in the double 
same precedence 
have left to right mode 
long long int  have 10^18 
doble 
setprecison(0)
generates double value with 0 no. of digits after decimal 
int main ()
int l,b; // long long int l,b;
cin>>l>>b;
cout<<l*1LL*b<<endl;/// when we require the answer in the format of long long int ;
// and the given inputs are in the form of integers
